Cryptographic Ciphers using C++
This repository contains menu driven implementation of following cryptographic ciphers using C++.

The ciphers that have been implemented are as follows:

1. Caesar Cipher
2. Substitution Cipher
3. Affine Cipher
4. Vigenere Cipher
5. Playfair Cipher

## Caesar Cipher
The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down the alphabet.
For example, with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on.
